A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects computers within a limited area such as a home, 
school, computer lab, or office. To build a LAN, several networking devices are used. 
Each device plays a specific role in communication, data transfer, security, and performance.

1. Network Devices (In Detail)
1.1. NIC (Network Interface Card)
NIC is the hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a network.
Can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
Each NIC has a unique MAC address used for identification.
Functions:
Converts data from parallel to serial format.
Acts as the interface between computer and network.

1.2. Hub
A basic networking device used to connect multiple computers.
Works on Physical Layer (Layer 1).
Broadcasts data to all connected devices → causes network traffic.
Does NOT filter data or store MAC addresses.
Use Case: Small, simple networks where security and performance are not major requirements.

1.3. Switch
Works on Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
More intelligent than hub.
Maintains MAC Address Table.
Sends data only to the intended device, not to everyone.
Advantages:
Reduces collisions.
Faster communication.
More secure.
Use Case: Used widely in modern LANs.

1.4. Router
Connects multiple networks together (e.g., LAN to Internet).
Works on Network Layer (Layer 3).
Uses IP addresses, routing tables, and routing protocols.
Functions:
Packet forwarding.
Network traffic management.
Provides gateway to internet.

1.5. Modem
Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa.
Required when using telephone lines or cable connections for internet.
Example: JioFiber modem, BSNL modem, Airtel modem.

1.6. Access Point (AP)
Provides wireless connectivity.
Extends Wi-Fi range in a building.
Functions:
Connects wireless devices to wired LAN.
Supports multiple users.

1.7. Repeater
Amplifies or regenerates weak network signals.
Used to extend the distance of LAN cables or Wi-Fi signals.

1.8. Bridge
Connects two LAN segments.
Works at Layer 2.
Prevents unnecessary traffic using MAC filtering.

1.9. Gateway
Acts as a “translator” between different protocols.
Used when two networks use different communication formats.
